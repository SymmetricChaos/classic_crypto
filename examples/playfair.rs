    println!("The Playfair family of ciphers are substitution ciphers that encrypts digraphs (pairs of letters) rather than single letters. This has a effect of making cryptanalysis significantly harder than a simple substitution cipher. The keyspace is the square of the size of the alphabet so 625 for a 25 letter alphabet and 1296 for a 36 letter alphabet. Frequency analysis is also far more difficult since digraphs are less distinctive than letters.");
